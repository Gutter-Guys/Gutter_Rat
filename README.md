Gantry mod for the ender 6


Currently there are two options available - GR6 and GR9. 

It is recommended to look at GR9 as your first option as it is the simpliest upgrade path from a stock Ender 6. GR6 is only for those that wish to run a 6mm belt setup to possibly use the VZBot style of EVA tool heads. Definitely for those more experienced in modifying or customising printers.

The GR9 version is designed to be built with as much of the stock system as possible. Belts, Pulleys, Spacers, Motherboard and Steppers can all be reused or upgraded if you wish. This flexibilty makes this a cheap upgrade to gain access to the brilliant EVA tool head system.
